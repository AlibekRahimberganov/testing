# learning how to connect Git and GitHub

First time to trying connect git and github by SSH key

This made by tutorial from w3schools.com

This file created in linux terminal and edited in GitHub.

During this process, I created some empty files in new branches, merged the branches, and pushed the changes to GitHub.
